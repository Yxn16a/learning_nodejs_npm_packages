// endpoints: are called with prural name and they are called collections
// rest:representational state transfer
// state and representational: how server make the data available 
// transfer: how data is transfered to the user
//rest must use already existing standards
// those include HTTP, JSON(java script standard data), URLS 
// use what you already have in web 
// endpoints represent the collection of data
// Get, post, put, Delete : are used to do action in the server 
// client and server
// request are statatless and cacheable
// request are not connected and they are statless which means they 
// are independent of the client and they are cacheable which means we 
// save the request the client makes and next time they request it 
// we do not search for it but we do not keep track of the user who are requesting 
// the data as in php
// in rest we do not need to track the number of users in sessions  as php does
// this minimizes the work  that the server does 
// back them:
// functions were being used
